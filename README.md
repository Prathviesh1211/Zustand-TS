# Zustand Todo App 🧠✅
Zustand is a fast, small, and scalable state-management library for React apps. It provides a simple API to manage global state without boilerplate or reducers (like in Redux).

In this project, Zustand is used to:
-Store and manage the list of todos
-Add, toggle, and delete todos from a centralized state
-Keep state logic separated and clean using custom hooks

This is a simple and elegant Todo App built using:

- ⚛️ React + TypeScript
- 🧠 Zustand for state management
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS for styling
